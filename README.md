##Discription: 
This project demonstrates a real-time client-server chat application using Java Sockets and multithreading, providing an interactive way to understand network programming in Java. The application consists of two main components: Server.java, which listens for client connections and relays messages, and Client.java, which connects to the server for sending and receiving messages. The server supports multiple clients using multi-threading, enables broadcast messaging, and handles graceful disconnections. On the client side, real-time communication is achieved through continuous message reception, while user input is managed via the Scanner class. Developed and executed in Eclipse IDE, this project showcases essential networking concepts in Java.
